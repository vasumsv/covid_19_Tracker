import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load COVID-19 data
covid_data = pd.read_csv('covid_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the data
print(covid_data.head())

# Plot COVID-19 cases over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(covid_data['Date'], covid_data['Cases'])
plt.title('COVID-19 Cases Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cases')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

#In this example, we assume you have a CSV file named covid_data.csv containing COVID-19 data with columns like 'Date' and 'Cases'. You would replace this with your actual data source.

#If you want to create a predictive model for COVID-19, you would need machine learning and data analysis libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, and you would require a dataset with features related to COVID-19 cases, such as demographics, symptoms, and test results.

#Keep in mind that diagnosing COVID-19 accurately requires medical testing and professional expertise, and Python is primarily used for data analysis and modeling in this context.
